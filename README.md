# Installfest

Here you will find the different set of instuctions for your installation. Depending on the OS you are on, please follow the instructions in the respective section.

Before you get started, here is an **IMPORTANT** point to note. At any point when you are prompted to enter a password, what you type will not be reflected on the `Terminal` app (for MacOS) or `WSL` app (for windows). Please remember whatever password you are typing!

## MacOS

For MacOS, follow the instructions in [this](./instructions/macos-installation.md) document.

## Windows

For Windows, follow the instructions in [this](https://github.com/wuzhixiang88/GA_Projects/tree/main/installfest_windows) document.

Unfortunately, I am not a windows user. The linked document above was written by one of the students from my previous batch. and he has run the same set of instructions a couple of times. So I would think it will be good enough for you to set up your environment.

## Text Editor

There are different text editors available for you to choose from such as Sublime, Atom, VS Code and others. However, in past batches, we have mainly used VS Code.

For Windows users, the instructions in the given link above would have asked you to install VS Code and explained how you can link it to your WSL. You should follow the instructions in that document.

For Mac users, if you have not installed a text editor, you can consider installing VS Code. You can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## Optional

- To setup `ssh`, follow [this](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh) link.
