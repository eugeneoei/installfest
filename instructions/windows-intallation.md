# Installation for Windows

For windows users, please follow the instructions on this [link](https://github.com/wuzhixiang88/GA_Projects/tree/main/installfest_windows).

Unfortunately, I amm not a windows user. This document was written by one of the students in my previous batch. and he has run the same set of instructions a couple of times. so I would think it will be good enough for you to set up your environment.
